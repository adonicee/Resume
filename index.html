        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Sanaz Hassani! With a background in architecture and a strong passion for design, I’ve transitioned from creating physical spaces to crafting engaging digital experiences. My journey began with architecture, where I honed my skills in blending functionality with aesthetics. This passion led me to UX/UI design, and I completed a 6-month certification from Google to deepen my expertise. As a freelance UX/UI designer, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, helping clients create user-centered designs that are both intuitive and visually appealing. My freelance experience has sharpened my skills in hand-coding HTML, exploring JavaScript. I am now excited to advance my skills further in web design and development, turning my self-taught knowledge into professional mastery. Whether you're interested in collaborating or simply exploring my work, welcome to my site!</p>
